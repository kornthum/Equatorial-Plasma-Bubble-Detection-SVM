Equatorial Plasma Bubble Detection using SVM

This is one of my project in Aeronautical Communication and Navigation course at KMITL. There are two machine learning methods: Faster R-CNN and SVM.
This repo is mainly focuses on Support Vector Machine (SVM).

**Abstract:** Equatorial Plasma Bubble (EPB) is triggering a slew of communication issues. It occurs in the F region of the ionosphere. As a result, finding it will improve communication that spreads through the ionosphere and alleviate communication issues. Artificial intelligence has advanced in recent years and could be used in real-world applications. In this study, we used two common algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Faster R-CNN, to construct a detector. According to the findings of this analysis, SVM provided 94.87 percent of classification accuracy, and Faster R-CNN, which is a localization model, provided a good regression and classification on an EPB occurrence area. So, in this regard, these two algorithms are effective at detecting EPB
